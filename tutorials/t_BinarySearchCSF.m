% Description:
%   Simulating Casagrande's 1984 CSF method (used with
%   treeshrews) in ISETBio. However, the steps can be used for simulating
%   the task on humans optics as well. The key steps are as follows:
%
%   1) Choose the specific spatial frequencies for which you will
% determine the sensitivity to contrast. Currently, ISETBio can only model
% the high-frequency CSF dropoff, not the low-frequency dropoff. Casagrande
% found that the high-frequency dropoff for tree shrews was between 0.75
% and 2 cycles/degree.
%
%   2) For each spatial frequency, determine the contrast level (AKA
% the contrast threshold) that causes the tree shrews to accurately discern
% the contrast 75% of the time.
%
%     * In ISETBio, this step is accomplished by using a support vector
%       machine (SVM) approach to determine the fraction of the time that
%       the algorithm can detect a difference in the mosaic excitation
%       between a null scene and a scene with a contrast. A binary search
%       algorithm is used to identify the specific contrast that leads to
%       75% of the SVM predictions being accurate.
%
%       The binary search works as follows: The spatial frequency of the
%       gabor stimulus is set at the beginning of the search, and is held
%       constant throughout. A minimum and maximum contrast is chosen, with
%       the assumption that the 75% contrast is within the chosen range.
%       The steps involved in the binary search process are well-described
%       in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm.
%
%   3) Calculate the contrast sensitivity at each spatial frequency by
% taking the reciprocal of the threshold contrast.
%
%   4) Plot the sensitivity as a function of the spatial frequency.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%   csfData - Character array or structure input referencing previously
%       gathered data, if you are specifically interested in plotting that.
%   dataName - If you have a specific choice for the name of the generated
%       data, you can input dataName as a character array.
%   overwrite - If there is already a dataset with the same name, do you
%       want to overwrite it? true/false.
%   saveToWS - If you're just exploring the code, you may want to save the
%       generated data to the workspace after it is created. Logical.

%% What do you want to do?
%
% If you're not interested in computing a new CSF, but instead want to
% simply plot prevously gathered data, then input either the name of the
% CSF dataset or the data structure itself into the function. Otherwise,
% leave the input field empty.

%% Parameters

% What species are you interested in simulating? Choose 'treeshrew' or
% 'human'.
species = 'treeshrew';

% If you're simulating tree shrews, what do you want the cone density
% of your mosaic to be? This is controlled by changing the minimum cone
% separation.
%   - min cone separation of 6 um     ->      ~ 32,000 cones/mm^2
%   - min cone separation of 7.5 um   ->      ~ 22,000 cones/mm^2
%   - min cone separation of 8.5 um   ->      ~ 16,000 cones/mm^2
cone_spacing = 7.5; %um

% What do you want the standard deviation of the point-spread function
% to be? For humans, this value is approximately 7 um. For tree shrews,
% our preliminary analyses have indicated the value is around 12 um.
psfSigma = 12; %um

% How large do you want the stimulus, and therefore the activated cone
% mosaic, to be? The Casagrande paper used a stimulus of ~14 x 14
% degrees. However, this would take a very long time to run the SVM, so
% we recommend using a size of between 4x4 and 7x7 degrees
sizeDegs = 5; % degrees per side

% What discrete spatial frequencies do you want to find the
% sensitivities for? The Casagrande paper showed a treeshrew CSF
% dropoff in the range of 0.75 - 2 cycles/degree, while for humans it
% is in the range of 1 - 10 cycles/degree.
frequencyRange = 0.75:0.25:2; %cycles per degree

% What range of contrasts do you want to explore for the spatial
% frequencies? Make it wide enough to include accuracies other than
% 100% and 50%!
contrastRange = [.001,.03];

% For the binary search, what range do you want it to reach before
% stopping?
desiredAccRange = [74.5,75.5];

% For the binary search, how many iterations do you want before
% stopping? As appealing as it may be to set a high number here, it is
% important to remember that a mere 10 iterations will lead to 1/1024
% of the original search range- likely past the precision of the SVM.
maxCycles = 8;

% When plotting, it is important to remember that the sensitivity of the
% ideal observer will be much higher than the behaviorally-observed
% sensitivity. This has been shown to be at least a factor of 20. The
% parameter toDivide simply shifts the sensitivity function downward before
% plotting.
toDivide = 20;
